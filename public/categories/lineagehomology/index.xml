      <description>Modeling the growth rate of transmission lineages We are working on a project where we try to illuminate some aspect of lineage dynamics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We are focusing on four locations divided into small scale: Norway and Australia, and large scale: Europe and the USA. For each of the four geographical locations we have used LineageHomology to define transmission lineages wrt. each of those locations. A “transmission lineage” is group of tips on a phylogeny that are are estimated to stem from the same importation event.</description>
