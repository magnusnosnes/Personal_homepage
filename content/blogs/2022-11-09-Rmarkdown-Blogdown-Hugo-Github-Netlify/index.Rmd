## Everything seems to be up running correctly!

I spent the last day or so figuring out how to get a personal website running from R studio

## Proof that I actually got it running

```{r remedy001, fig.height=10, fig.width=10,fig.align="center"}
library(ape)
set.seed(10)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(rlineage(0.1, 0)) # Yule process with lambda = 0.1
title("Yule process with lambda = 0.1")
plot(rlineage(0.1, 0.05)) # simple birth-death process
title("Birth death process")
b <- function(t) 1/(1 + exp(0.2*t - 1)) # logistic
curve(b, 0, 50, xlab = "Time", ylab = "")
mu <- 0.07
segments(0, mu, 50, mu, lty = 2)
legend("topright", c(expression(lambda), expression(mu)),
       lty = 1:2, bty = "n")
plot(rlineage(b, mu), show.tip.label = FALSE)
title("Simulated with 'rlineage'")

```
